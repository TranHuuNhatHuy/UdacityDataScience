# DATA ANALYSIS - SIGNIFICANT EARTHQUAKES, 1965-2016

I live in Tokyo. Recently there are not much earthquakes around here, and to be honest I quite miss that thrilling experience of feeling the vibrant through my body. Coincidentally, I am taking Udacity Nanodegree - Data Scientists. Thus, I would like to have a dive into earthquake data, with these 3 questions:

1. Which places are most vulnerable to earthquakes and seismic activities around the world, and in Japan?
2. What are the nature characteristics of heavy earthquakes? Which factors determine a strong earthquake?
3. Sometimes a seismic activity is caused by nuclear explosion. How can we detect a nuclear explosion based on seismic data solely?

The complete blog of this analysis could be viewed on my [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/@trnhunhthuy/a-little-gaze-into-the-earthquake-dataset-a23cfb0c6b0d).
