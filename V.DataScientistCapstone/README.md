# DATA SCIENTIST CAPSTONE PROJECT - STARBUCKS

## Contents

The Starbucks Capstone Project is a key component of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program, providing students with a hands-on opportunity to apply their skills and knowledge gained throughout the program to a real-world business challenge. This project is developed in collaboration with Starbucks, a global coffeehouse chain where the author enjoys sipping their matcha latte every day, making it an engaging and relevant experience for aspiring data scientists such as the author.

Starbucks, a renowned brand in the food and beverage industry, has provided simulated data that mimics customer behavior on their rewards mobile app. The dataset spans diverse aspects of customer interactions, including offers received, viewed, and completed, as well as transaction details. The primary objective of the capstone project is to analyze this dataset and develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will respond to a particular offer.
