    "# Starbucks Capstone Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Starbucks Capstone Project is a key component of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program, providing students with a hands-on opportunity to apply their skills and knowledge gained throughout the program to a real-world business challenge. This project is developed in collaboration with Starbucks, a global coffeehouse chain where the author enjoys sipping their matcha latte everyday, making it an engaging and relevant experience for aspiring data scientists such as the author.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starbucks, a renowned brand in the food and beverage industry, has provided simulated data that mimics customer behavior on their rewards mobile app. The dataset spans diverse aspects of customer interactions, including offers received, viewed, and completed, as well as transaction details. The primary objective of the capstone project is to analyze this dataset and develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will respond to a particular offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You\"ll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You\"ll be given transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "You\"ll also want to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don\"t receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, you wouldn\"t want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. You\"ll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a capstone project, you are free to analyze the data any way you see fit. For example, you could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. Or you could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. Or, you don\"t need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A)."

    "As I found out above that negative records significantly outnumber positive records with a 4:1 ratio which is extremely imbalance, it is crucial to consider the balance between precision and recall. Precision and recall are often in tension with each other - increasing one typically leads to a decrease in the other (precision-recall trade-off). Achieving a balance between precision and recall is important to ensure that the model is making predictions that are both accurate (high precision) and comprehensive (high recall).\n",

    "In summary, the analysis suggests that while some models have high accuracy, there is room for improvement in identifying positive instances, especially in the context of imbalanced datasets. Consideration of precision, recall, and F1 Score provides insights into the trade-offs made by each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are still rooms for improvements:\n",
    "- Addressing the class imbalance and potentially adjusting the decision threshold may improve the models' performance.\n",
    "- Further hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering could be explored to enhance model effectiveness.\n",
    "- Evaluation using precision-recall curves and AUC-PR can provide a more detailed understanding of model performance across different decision thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, during data cleaning and exploring for the model, I have found several key insights:\n",
    "- Regarding coffee consumption, people in the middle ages like 50 to 60 drink most coffee compared to other age groups, indicating a high level of cofee consumption around this age.\n",
    "- Income shows a lot of people with low or average income going to Starbucks. People with higher incomes, especially those six-figure guys seem to not really enjoying Starbucks coffee compared to the lower income groups.\n",
    "- Regarding offer reception, we can see a general trend where males view, receive and complete more offers than females and others. On the other hand, females have higher ratio of offer completion over received & view than those in males.\n",
    "- Although BOGO and Discount share the same received counts, Discount offer type is more successful than BOGO, with the most prominent two being Discount type."
